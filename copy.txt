/A haunting, darkly comic space opera set in a post-Earth universe, in which human beings are rare and human relationships are sparse./

Daedalus Mole is a courier, an alcoholic and one of the last few thousand humans alive. He's also broke. When his day off becomes an opportunity to make some fast cash, he finds himself dragged into a game of interstellar cat-and-mouse, where the cats are numerous and the mouse is a high-strung teenage fugitive.

While Daedalus tries to figure out where his next drink is coming from, an adventure insists on happening near him, his charge insists on digging up his past, and a cast of dangerous losers insist on joining his crew; all under the eye of a sinister intellect with a mysterious agenda.
